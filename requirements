My first independent tool for internal purpose is wrrtten and completed in three days. I think it will be helpful to us in next some days to automate whole process of deployment of standard and its data to server.

Before this it was a very hectic process which includes some compulsary steps to be followed. But now it is reduced to almost single command level. 

I will keep this software updated according to our needs and purposes and requirements.

Bye.
